# tic-tac-toe
A simple tic-tac-toe game in which a user can play against an AI. A key feature of this game was that when a user was using a 
a mouse to navigate he/she coulde preview a placement of an X/O.  Meaning that when the user hovered the pointer over a box the
X/O would appear but not place the letter.  Another key feature was to find an algorithm in which the computer would choose the 
best placement of a letter making it very difficult for the user to win.

## Usage
User can choose between the letter X and O.  Choosing a difficulty of 'Easy' will have the computer choose a random open square
making winning much easier.  Choosing 'Hard' will have the computer choose the best spot based on making moves ahead and seeing
the resulting outcome of making that move.
